The city is divided into **39 districts** in total, 14 of them belong to the Asian side and the other 25 belong to the European side. However, the fact that the districts are squeezed into an area of approximately **72** square kilometers causes the city to have a very intertwined and mixed structure.\n\nThe city has been always a destination for students around the world to start or continue their studies, where it has **52** universities out of 175 universities in all Turkey. When we think of the city students, they probably want to choose the regions where rental housing values are low. At the same time, they may want to choose the district according to the social places density.\n\nWhen we consider the previous problem, we can create a map and information chart where the *rental housing index* is placed on Istanbul and each district is clustered according to the *venues density*."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
